# Refactor Overview Document

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the ongoing refactor of this codebase. The refactor aims to improve code structure, enhance maintainability, and ensure efficiency. In this codebase, rendering Dart language bindings directly from Rust should involve using Rust traits `DartCodeOracle`, `Renderer`, `CodeType`, and `Renderable` to abstractly define the conversion logic for various Rust types and structures into their Dart equivalents. Each Rust component (functions, enums, structs) implements `CodeType` and `Renderable` traits to generate Dart syntax, ensuring type-safe, consistent representation across languages without relying on external templates. This method leverages Rust's paradigms, efficiently mapping complex Rust structures to Dart, while maintaining type integrity and language idiomatics through the use of `Renderer` and `DartCodeOracle`.

## Refactor Goals
- Improve modularity and organization.
- Standardize type generation and rendering.
- Streamline Dart-specific functionalities.
- Enhance maintainability and documentation.
- Facilitate efficient memory management in FFI contexts.

## Key Components of Refactor
1. **DartWrapper Struct**
2. **CodeType Trait**
3. **DartCodeOracle Struct**
4. **AsCodeType Conversion Method**
5. **Render and Renderable Trait**
6. **General Code Refactoring**
7. **Testing and Documentation**

## Additional Notes
- Members are encouraged to communicate openly about challenges and suggestions.
- Documentation is crucial. Please document all changes and their impact.

## Conclusion
This document serves as a guideline for the ongoing refactor process. It is a dynamic document and should be updated as the refactor progresses.
